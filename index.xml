      <description>The Cluster The cluster is made up of 1 head node and 10 compute nodes. Of the compute nodes, 8 are AMD based systems while the other 2 are Intel based systems. Here is the following hardware stack for all of the nodes:
   Node Type Node Name Processor RAM HDD (/tmp) Extra Components     Head Node robotarium AMD Opteron 6320 (8 cores) 64 GB 916 GB &amp;mdash;   AMD Compute Node gpu01, gpu02, gpu03, gpu04, gpu05, gpu06 4x AMD Opteron 6376 (64 cores) 512 GB 40 GB NVIDIA K20 GPU, (2x in gpu06)   AMD Compute Node (Large RAM) gpu07, gpu08 4x AMD Opteron 6376 (64 cores) 1024 GB 40 GB NVIDIA K20 GPU (only in gpu07), 2x NVIDIA Titan Xp GPUs (only in gpu08)   Intel Compute Node mic01, mic02 2x Intel Xeon E5-2650v2 (16 cores) 128 GB 40 GB &amp;mdash;   NVIDIA DGX1 Node dgx01 2x Intel Xeon E5-2698v4 (40 cores) 512 GB 440 GB (7 TB at /raid/scratch) 8x NVIDIA Tesla P100    In addition to the above listed nodes, there are also some special-purpose nodes &amp;mdash; specifically, the cluster has eight Intel MIC nodes:</description>

      <description>How To Here we provide some guides for various aspects of using the Robotarium cluster. The most important ones are listed directly below &amp;mdash; it is a good idea to familiarise yourselves with these first. Please be aware that some of the guides here are hosted on other sites and will need you to navigate away from here.

      <description>Terms and Conditions Mains Points  No guarantee of service or quality is given; the cluster is provided as a free service to members and affiliates of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics with regular maintenance done by a small group of volunteers. Nonetheless some effort is made to ensure continuous uptime and availability. Very limited support is given; we only have a few volunteers at hand to help, and who themselves are busy doing their own work.</description>
