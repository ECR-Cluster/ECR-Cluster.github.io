Quick Start
===========

This guide provides a _quick-n-dirty_ series of steps to get you started on the
cluster. The guides assumes the following:

 * you have an account on the cluster
 * you have experience with Linux-based systems (_especially_ the command line)
 * you have a SSH public-private key pair

Alright then, _lift off!_
