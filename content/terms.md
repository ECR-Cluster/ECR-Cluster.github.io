Terms and Conditions
====================

Mains Points
------------

 1. No guarantee of service or quality is given; the cluster is provided as a
    free service to members and affiliates of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics
    with regular maintenance done by a *small* group of volunteers. Nonetheless
    some effort is made to ensure continuous uptime and availability.
 1. **Very** limited support is given; we only have a few volunteers at hand to
    help, and who themselves are busy doing their own work.
 1. No backups are made of user data; users are expected to keep copies (on
    other systems or storage devices) of their work, *we take no responsibility
    for any loss of user data*!
 1. No guarantees are made regarding the availability of hardware resources; the
    cluster is setup in a first-come first-serve fashion, as such it is possible
    that you might find hardware resources that you want to use allocated to
    another user.
 1. The hardware resources are managed through a batch-queue system; any attempt
    at bypassing it is strictly forbidden and will result in your account being
    deactivated (possibly permanently).
 1. Any work done with the cluster that leads to a publication, or other output,
    must acknowledge it within that publication (and ideally reference it as
    well)!

**These terms are subject to change at anytime, please check this page regularly!**

Acknowledgement
---------------

Any use of the cluster that leads to a publication or other output **must**
acknowledge the cluster as a resource within the output. A possible formulation
of this for a conference article is:

> … we acknowledge our use of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics' Robotarium
> Cluster located at Heriot-Watt University, provided through funding by
> Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Centre for Doctoral
> Training in Robotics and Autonomous Systems through grant EP/L016834/1 …

Referencing
-----------

In addition to the acknowledgement, you can directly reference the cluster as a
resource for your publication:

```bibtex

  author       = {Edinburgh Centre for Robotics},
  title        = {Robotarium Cluster},
  month        = nov,
  year         = 2014,
  note         = {{The cluster is part of the EPSRC Centre for
                   Doctoral Training in Robotics and Autonomous

                   funded by The Engineering and Physical Sciences
                   Research Council (EPSRC) (UK).}},
